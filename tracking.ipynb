## Bank Customer Churn - Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

This analysis dives into the **Bank Customer Churn** dataset, revealing insights that influence customer churn. A modular approach using design patterns ensures clean, maintainable, and scalable code for basic data inspection, univariate, bivariate, and multivariate analyses. You can collect the data from [here](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/radheshyamkollipara/bank-customer-churn).

### Design Pattern Overview

In this project, I utilized the **Strategy Design Pattern**. This pattern allows the definition of a family of algorithms and makes them interchangeable without altering the clients that use them. This promotes flexibility and reusability in code.

### Analysis Components
- **Basic Data Inspection**: Utilizes different inspection strategies to analyze the dataset's structure, including data types, non-null counts, and summary statistics. This provides foundational insights into the dataset before further analysis.
- **Univariate Analysis**: Isolated feature exploration using `UnivariateAnalyzer` with separate handlers for numerical and categorical data. This helps in understanding the distribution and characteristics of individual features.
- **Bivariate Analysis**: Relationships between two variables explored with `BivariateAnalyzer`. This allows for the identification of correlations and interactions between different features.
- **Multivariate Analysis**: Complex interactions analyzed through `SimpleMultivariateAnalysis`. This approach helps in understanding how multiple variables affect customer churn simultaneously.
